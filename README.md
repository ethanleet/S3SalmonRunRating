# Splatoon 3 Salmon Run Next Wave Rotation Rating
This project aims to provide a rating between 0 and 10 to a Salmon Run Next Wave rotation, given a stage and the four weapons, where a higher rating indicates a easier rotation. The training data are mostly from the year of 2024.

## Data Source
Rotation data and rating info are scraped from Manpuku-chan's X/Twitter account [@tenohirasize](https://x.com/tenohirasize?s=21&t=ToEwa-WXDFp3QHchAhoH8Q).
